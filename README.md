# 🔫 Revolver CAD Model

This project contains a **visually accurate 3D CAD model** of a revolver created using **SolidWorks**. The model is built for visual demonstration and design presentation purposes. It replicates the external features of a typical revolver but is **not mechanically functional**.

## 📌 Project Overview

- ✅ Realistic external geometry
- ❌ No internal mechanical functionality
- 🎯 Intended for concept display, renders, or educational references

## 📁 Files Included

- `.SLDPRT` – Individual part files
- `.SLDASM` – Complete assembly file
- `.PNG`/`.JPG` – Rendered images and screenshots
- (Optional) `.MP4` or `.GIF` – Demo or exploded view animation

## 🧩 Components Modeled

- Frame  
- Cylinder  
- Barrel  
- Trigger  
- Grip  

## 🛠 Tools & Software

- **SolidWorks 2023**
- Assembly module for part integration
- Appearances & rendering tools for visual output

## 📝 Notes

- The model does **not** simulate real-world revolver mechanics.
- All components are dimensioned and assembled for visual correctness only.
- This project is part of a personal learning and design exploration initiative.
